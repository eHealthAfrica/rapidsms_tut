This directory contains a partial clone of the actual test salt stack
 used at the time this snapshot was taken.

At that time, it (the complete stack of which this is a part)
performed a successful installation of the package to an
Ubuntu 10.04 server instance.

These files are for example only, and will not be maintained and should not be considered definitive.
